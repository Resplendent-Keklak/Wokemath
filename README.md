## Description
> DISCLAIMER: The title of this repository is a joke. The term "woke" is used *ironically*.

Wokemath is a tiny Python script used to allow clients to run a script in a supported command prompt, a Repl, or any similar script processor to correct common instances of discriminatory language in writing. Users will enter text into the program when prompted, such as the input text they are trying to process, and receive the more "woke," revised version of said input alongside comments that warn the user who entered the text which parts of their entry are unacceptable.

So far, the timeline for the development of this script is unclear since it just began, but the developer hopes to continue making new releases for each time new forms of written discrimination against marginalized individuals come into existence.
